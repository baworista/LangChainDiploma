- **Weaknesses**: Underutilization of knowledge resources from past projects indicates a gap in leveraging insights.
- **Recommendations**: Establish a centralized knowledge management platform to facilitate documentation and sharing of lessons learned from past projects.

### 8. Decision-Making Processes
- **Weaknesses**: Critical processes such as production and lifecycle costing are often overlooked, leading to suboptimal outcomes.
- **Recommendations**: Develop a comprehensive decision-making framework incorporating financial modeling and feasibility assessments for balanced decision-making.

### 9. Use of Tools and Technologies
- **Strengths**: Effective use of CAD and PDM/PLM systems supports product development.
- **Weaknesses**: Advanced simulation tools are underutilized, limiting potential benefits.
- **Recommendations**: Conduct a technology audit and provide focused training on underutilized tools to maximize their potential in improving product quality.

### 10. Compliance and Sustainability Considerations
- **Weaknesses**: Compliance and sustainability are not systematically prioritized in product development.
- **Recommendations**: Form a sustainability committee and utilize data analytics to integrate compliance and sustainability metrics into the product design process.

## Recommendations Summary

To enhance product management maturity, the multinational manufacturing company should:
