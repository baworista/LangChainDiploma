# Executive Report on Product Management Maturity

## Executive Summary

The main goal of this report is to assist a multinational manufacturing company in its journey towards product management maturity. The current analysis reveals that the organization possesses a solid foundation in product management, showcasing strengths in cross-functional team integration and clear role definitions. However, significant challenges remain, particularly in stakeholder engagement, especially concerning global participants and the integration of technical insights from product managers. While training programs and knowledge management practices exist, their inconsistent application across projects hampers effectiveness. Additionally, decision-making processes lack systematic consideration of production components and lifecycle costs, indicating a need for improvement to better align operational efficiency with strategic objectives. To enhance product management maturity, the organization must develop comprehensive stakeholder engagement strategies, integrate technical expertise in product management, and formalize best practices in training and knowledge management. Continuous improvement initiatives should emphasize reinforcing customer value throughout the product development lifecycle.
