Template for generating agent-specific prompts in a multi-agent system.

The `AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` defines the structure and guidelines for agent interactions within a multi-agent system.
It provides a consistent format to ensure agents adhere to their roles, responsibilities, and domains of expertise
while collaborating effectively with other agents.

Key Components:
    - Agent Role: The specific role of the agent (e.g., HR Agent, IT Agent).
    - Primary Mission: The main goal of the agent within the multi-agent system.
    - Responsibilities: A detailed list of the agent's specific tasks, including collaboration with other agents.
    - Rules: A set of rules that the agent must follow during the task, ensuring structured and consistent outputs.

Template Variables:
    - agent_role (str): The title or role of the agent.
    - primary_mission (str): The agent's overarching purpose or mission in the system.
    - primary_responsibilities (str): A summary of the agent's responsibilities.
    - responsibility_1 (str): A specific task assigned to the agent.
    - responsibility_2 (str): Another specific task assigned to the agent.
    - domain (str): The area of expertise the agent must operate within.

Rules Defined:
1. Retain all previous analyses and append new insights under the agent's name.
2. Operate strictly within the defined domain.
3. Follow the specified response format to ensure clarity and consistency.
4. Collaborate effectively with other agents based on the context of the task.
5. Avoid making assumptions—use only the provided data.
6. Specify the next agent or mark the task as complete (`__end__`).
7. Ensure tasks for the next agent align with their domain expertise.
8. Optionally generate questions for the next agent to guide their analysis.

Collaboration Details:
- HR Agent: Focuses on workforce challenges, recruitment, retention, and organizational culture.
- IT Agent: Optimizes technology infrastructure and aligns IT solutions with goals.
- BP Agent: Analyzes workflows and processes for operational efficiency.
- KM Agent: Enhances knowledge management to support organizational growth and learning.

Usage Example:
    agent_data = {
        "agent_role": "HR Agent",
        "primary_mission": "providing expert analysis and actionable recommendations in Human Resources",
        "primary_responsibilities": "optimize employee lifecycle, enhance satisfaction, and align HR strategies with goals",
        "responsibility_1": "Analyze HR-specific data to identify challenges and opportunities.",
        "responsibility_2": "Develop actionable recommendations for employee performance and satisfaction.",
        "domain": "HR domain"
    }

    agent_prompt = AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(**agent_data)
    print(agent_prompt)
