DONE 1 - Subgraph for each team
    Supervisor returns State for each team via Send
    Teams names must be hardcoded(name node, not generated name)

HALF 2 - In teams(reviewers -> from their team state) must be return Command(
        update={
            ---
        },
        goto="supervisor",
    )

    Add last report sending back to supervisor

3 - Supervisor should wait for answers from all teams - smth like
    if reviewer_final_overview.lengh=4
        goto report_writer

    Could be implemented in initialize_research_states function where we can Send() or wait

4 - implement correct agent talking

DONE 5 - Should agent prompts be generated by gpt(less control but prompt is generated on topic)


NOTES:

# app_builder.add_node("supervisor_tools", ToolNode([create_analysts_tool])) - additional for graph visualizing
