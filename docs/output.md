   - Best Practices: Organizations should establish mechanisms for real-time feedback and continuous adaptation of processes to meet evolving market demands.
   - Gaps Identified: The current approach to continuous improvement is not systematically integrated into product development, resulting in missed opportunities for innovation.

4. **Knowledge Management**
   - Current Practices: Knowledge management processes exist but are not fully utilized to capture and leverage client feedback effectively. The integration of previous project learnings is sporadic.
   - Best Practices: Effective organizations employ formal knowledge management systems that facilitate the sharing of insights and lessons learned.
   - Gaps Identified: There is a significant need for structured methods to capture and utilize client feedback throughout the product lifecycle.
