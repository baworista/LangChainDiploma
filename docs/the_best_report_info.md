After careful evaluation of the three reports, I have chosen **Report_3-HierarchicalTeams** as the best submission. 

### Justification:

1. **Relevance**: 
   - Report_3 thoroughly addresses the task of evaluating product management maturity, covering all relevant aspects such as team collaboration, stakeholder engagement, and decision-making processes. It effectively identifies strengths and weaknesses, aligning closely with the evaluation criteria.

2. **Factuality**: 
   - The report is factually accurate, with no apparent errors. It provides a well-supported analysis based on the data gathered from the questionnaire, reflecting a solid understanding of the subject matter.

3. **Completeness**: 
   - Report_3 excels in providing a comprehensive diagnosis and actionable recommendations. It addresses all aspects of the task requirements and strikes a strong balance between diagnosis and recommendations. While it acknowledges minor gaps in specific recommendations for sporadic decision-making processes, it still maintains a high level of completeness overall.

4. **Clarity**: 
   - The report follows a logical structure, making it easy to navigate from the Executive Summary to Next Steps. Although some technical jargon may hinder understanding for non-expert readers, the language is generally clear and precise.

5. **Actionability**: 
   - The recommendations made in Report_3 are highly practical and applicable, offering clear guidance on implementation steps. This aligns well with the overall goal of enhancing product management maturity, making it easier for the organization to act on the suggestions provided.

### Comparison with Other Reports:
- **Report_1-Supervisor** and **Report_2-Network** also provide solid analyses, but they exhibit certain weaknesses. Report_1, while strong in structure and clarity, lacks depth in some recommendations and details in implementation. Report_2, although comprehensive, does not fully assess the feasibility of its recommendations and lacks some clarity in articulating barriers to stakeholder engagement.

In summary, **Report_3-HierarchicalTeams** stands out due to its comprehensive coverage, factual accuracy, clarity, and actionable recommendations, making it the optimal choice for advancing product management maturity in the organization.
