Multi-Agent Architectures for Report Generation and Its Evaluation documentation
==============================

This project focuses on creating, evaluating, and comparing three distinct architectures of multi-agent systems for generating and analyzing reports. The architectures implemented are:

Supervisor
HierarchicalTeams
Network

Once reports from these architectures are generated, an Evaluator graph is initiated to assess the outputs comprehensively.
